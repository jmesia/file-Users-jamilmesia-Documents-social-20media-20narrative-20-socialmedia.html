    <p> It had been few months already after waking up suspicious on weather they are dating or not. There has been plenty of Interviews done to both of them. Most of the time they answer" we are just friends". However one interview to Nicki Nicole on "Molusco y Los Reyes de la Punta" caught everyone by surprise. Nicki was asked if she was tired of being asked about her and Peso Pluma statues. Her answers was a shock to Peso Plumas fans. She basically compared him to a dog and a purse. Her words got lost in translation and many fans were angry. Nicki's words were "Imagine if you go out every day with a dog, no one will ask you why you go out every day with a dog; its normal." Overall she admitted "we are getting to know each other"</p>
